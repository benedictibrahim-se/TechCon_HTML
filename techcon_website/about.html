                1. TechCon didn't begin as the global powerhouse it is today. Its journey began in 2010 as a modest commuity meetup in San Jose
                California. Back then, it was simply a one-day event called "TechConnect", aimed at bringing together
                local developers and startups to exchange ideas.

                2. The first few years saw steady grwoth, with the conference expanding to include panels on cloud computing, mobile develoopment
                and open source software. By 2015, Tech Con officially rebranded from "TechConnect" and relocated to larger venues, with over
                2,000 attendees.

                3. A major turning point came in 2018, when TechCon introduced its "Future of AI" track, drawing attention from global tech giants
                and innovators. This shift positioned TechCon as a serious platform for not just networking, but also product debuts and high-level
                research presentations.
